Hi! I'm Daniel Justus, a software developer based in Tacoma, WA. I have extensive experience in React, Next.JS, .NET native app development, and UI design. I hold a Bachelor's of Science in Software Engineering as well as CompTIA Project+, ITIL Foundations, and CIW frontend development certifications. When I'm not coding, I enjoy gardening, playing music, writing, gaming, and exploring the Pacific Northwest with my dog Cooper. I'm passionate about learning new concepts to apply to challenging problems and delivering performant and accessible software that delights both clients and users. If you have an idea you want to bring to life, get in touch. Let's build something amazing together!
